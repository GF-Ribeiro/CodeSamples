This is from the project I developed for my undergraduate thesis. The idea was to create an algorithm that did not depend on knowing all the terrain before making any desition. The AI agent charts the terrain as it moves and makes its decision based on the mapped nodes. Its decision is based on an euristhic that takes into account the distance to the node and probability of finding new paths with that node.

AIBehaviour is the main controller of the agent
AiBrain is responsible for choosing the next node to navigate
AiMovent is responsible for moving the agent
MappingBehaviour is responsible for charting the nodes surrounding the agent

There are 2 examples showing the algorithm in action.

I also added my undergraduate thesis (Path Discovery), unfortunately, it is available only in Portuguese.
